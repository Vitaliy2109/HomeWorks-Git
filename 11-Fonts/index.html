                <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and
                    the app platform’s native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform’s
                    APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: <span
                        class="i">bundles of reusable, nestable code.</span> You can learn more about React in the next
                    section. But first, let’s cover how components work in React Native.</p>

                <p>React Native runs on <span class="underline"> React,</span> a popular open source library for
                    building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand
                    React itself. This section can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.</p>
                <p>We’re going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
                <p> <span class="bold">+ components.</span> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its
                    examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.</p>
                <p class="jsx"> <span class="bold">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you
                    write elements inside JavaScript like so: <span class="grey-bg">&lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your
                        cat!&lt;/Text&gt;</span> </p>
                <p>The React docs have <span class="underline">a comprehensive guide to JSX</span> you can refer to
                    learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring
                    a <span class="grey-bg">name</span> for the cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces inside
                    <span class="grey-bg">&lt;Text&gt;</span>
                </p>
                <p> <span class="bold">+ props.</span> Props is short for “properties”.</p>
                <p> <span class="bold">+ state.</span> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure
                    how components render, state is like a component’s personal data storage. State is useful for
                    handling data that changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your
                    components memory!</p>

            <section class="section-4 last">
                <div class="title">
                    <h2>handling text input</h2><span class="suptext">Chapter 4</span>
                </div>
                <p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an <span
                        class="i">onChangeText</span> prop that takes a function to be called every time the text
                    changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.
                </p>
                <p>For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different
                    language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: <img
                        src="assets/img/pizza.svg" alt="">. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as
                    "<img src="assets/img/pizza.svg" alt=""><img src="assets/img/pizza.svg" alt="">".</p>
